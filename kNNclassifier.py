# 6.     Write a computer program (Python/C++/Java) to implement the kNN classifier. Each group could choice your own favorite distance measures and values for the parameters involved in kNN. For example:
# a.      Use Euclidean distance  to calculate the distance between samples and pick 3 for k
# b.     Use Euclidean distance  to calculate the distance between samples and pick 5 for k
# c.      Use Manhattan distance  to calculate the distance between samples and pick 3 for k
# d.     Calculate distances based on one individual gene, pick 3 for k and then use jury decision (majority rule) for the classification
# e.      Calculate distances based on one individual gene, pick 5 for k and then use jury decision (majority rule) for the classification

# 7.     Use your classifier to classify the testing samples

# 8.     Report your results.
